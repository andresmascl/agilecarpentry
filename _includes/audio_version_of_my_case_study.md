# Audio Version of My LeSS Case Study

An audio version of [my LeSS case study](https://less.works/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company){:target="_blank"} regarding a Large Server Hardware Company is available at the following venues:
* [Agile Carpentry YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/DVmoFEmi4xU){:target="_blank"}
* [Agile Carpentry Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1bnMmFj7F6q0jXuEWHcSaq){:target="_blank"}
* [Agile Carpentry Podcast on every major podcast platform](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/agilecarpentry/){:target="_blank"}

The YouTube and Spotify versions contain video which shows the relevant figures as they are mentioned. The remaining venues are audio only.

The YouTube closed captions are based on the written case study text so they are much better than auto-generated captions. The auto-translated captions for other languages should therefore be reasonably good. Only the YouTube version has closed captions.
