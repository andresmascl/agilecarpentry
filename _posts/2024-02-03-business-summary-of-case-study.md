The business impact of what was achieved for the large server hardware company client during the period of my [LeSS case study](https://less.works/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company) is not as well articulated as it could be within the case study itself. 

This business focused summary will attempt to fill that void. Please see the case study itself for more of the overall context.

# Diagnostics Team

I led the effort to establish an agile team focused on creating improved hardware diagnostics capabilities. Every bi-weekly release added a few millions dollars of savings in warranty costs per year. The cumulative savings over the course of a year were easily on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. 

The diagnostic gap this team closed had gone unaddressed for many years due to organizational dysfunctions. The cross-functional cross-component team I stood up worked directly with the field support division, bypassing all the organizational cruft which had prevented the problem from being solved in years past.

# BIOS Teams

Following my success with the above diagnostics team, I helped restructure a large number of teams responsible for bringing up and integrating each new generation of Intel CPU within the blade computing product. In collaboration with the relevant senior director I facilitated a correction of the organizational issues, and the attendant engineering and cultural issues which had historically necessitated an army of engineers over a year to integrate each new generation of Intel CPU. 

Future generations of Intel CPU are expected to take a tenth of the calendar time, and a tenth of the engineering effort, historically required. Failure to successfully integrate the newest server grade Intel CPU generation prior to each Intel CPU official launch perpetually presents an existential threat to around a billion dollars of annual divisional revenue.

# Validating The Business Benefits

The best way to validate the claims above is to have me arrange a conversation with people who were at the client at the time.

Even if I still had access to the quantitative financial data for the diagnostics team, I wouldn't be able to show it to you without violating client confidentiality. 

Similarly, the vast improvements in the time required to integrate each new generation of Intel CPU into the BIOS would only have been fully realized in the subsequent CPU generation. Since Mitya and I had both left by that time, we were never able to fully quantify the improvements. Yet, we are both confident of the positive business impact the organizational changes made possible.

# Delivery Capability Lens

My LeSS case study is focused on improvements in delivery capability made possible through organizational change. These are summarized at the top of the case study as follows:

* Locally improved adaptability and value delivery within the extended component boundary
* Improved technical practices that created improved quality, along with improved awareness of what additional improvements could bring
* Early identification and resolution of defects related to the extended component
* Improved employee collaboration, engagement, and learning within the extended component teams
* Increased awareness of organizational impediments and the need to make even more organizational changes

The delivery capability lens is intended to guide the reader to a deeper understanding of how LeSS enables a more effective engineering organization. 

The delivery capability lens also proved valuable as scaffolding for mentorship during my journey through the LeSS trainer candidate process, which was the primary objective of the case study when it was being written.
