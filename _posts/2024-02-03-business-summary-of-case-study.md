This summary of my [LeSS case study](https://less.works/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company) focuses on the direct business impact of the work done during the period of my case study. See the case study itself for a delivery capability improvement perspective.

# Diagnostics Team

I led the effort to establish an agile team focused on creating improved hardware diagnostics capabilities. Every bi-weekly release added a few millions dollars of savings in warranty costs per year. __The cumulative savings over the course of a year were on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars.__

The diagnostics capability gap this team closed had gone unaddressed for many years due to organizational dysfunctions. The cross-functional cross-component team I stood up worked directly with the field support division, bypassing all the organizational cruft which had prevented the problem from being solved in years past.

# BIOS Teams

Following my success with the above diagnostics team, I helped restructure a large number of teams responsible for bringing up and integrating each new generation of Intel CPU within the blade computing product. 

In collaboration with the relevant senior director I facilitated a correction of the organizational issues, and the attendant engineering and cultural issues which had historically necessitated an army of engineers over a year to integrate each new generation of Intel CPU. 

__Future generations of Intel CPU are expected to take a tenth of the calendar time, and a tenth of the engineering effort that had historically been required.__ Failure to successfully integrate the newest server grade Intel CPU generation prior to each Intel CPU launch perpetually presents an existential threat to around a billion dollars of annual divisional revenue.

# Validating The Business Benefits

The best way to validate the claims above is to have me arrange a conversation with people who were at the client at the time.
