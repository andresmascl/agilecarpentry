In this summary of my LeSS case study, my goal is to highlight the direct business impact observed during the study period. I suggest exploring the [full case study](https://less.works/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company) for a more comprehensive understanding of the overall improvements in delivery capabilities.

I led the effort to establish an agile team dedicated to improving hardware diagnostics capabilities. With each bi-weekly release, we realized tangible savings, contributing millions of dollars annually in reduced warranty costs. The cumulative savings over a year reached a substantial figure, totaling __hundreds of millions of dollars__.

In attempting to address a longstanding diagnostics capability gap, this team faced challenges that had persisted for years due to deep-seated organizational issues. The critical success factors included restructuring into a cross-functional, cross-component team to collaborate directly with field support teams. Concurrently, significant enhancements in organizational design played a pivotal role in establishing and sustaining improved technical practices.

Success in this effort propelled a [follow-on initiative]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/billions-in-risk-avoidance/), mitigating a perpetual existential threat to more than a billion dollars of annual revenue. The study demonstrates the ongoing impact of our strategic and agile approach in addressing critical challenges.

# Validating The Business Benefits

The best way to validate the claims above is to have me arrange a conversation with people who were at the client at the time.
