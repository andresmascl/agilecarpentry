Hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings were realized by standing up a cross-functional cross-component hardware diagnostics team for the client covered by [my LeSS case study](https://less.works/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company).

The diagnostics capability gap this team closed had gone unaddressed for many years due to organizational dysfunctions. With the new diagnostics team, each bi-weekly release provided an additional few million of annual savings in warranty costs per year. __The cumulative savings in the first year alone were on the order of a hundred million dollars per annum.__

Success in this effort propelled a [follow-on effort]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/billions-in-risk-avoidance/) which made it possible to mitigate a perpetual existencial threat to more than a billion dollars of annual revenue.

# Validating The Business Benefits

The best way to validate the claims above is to have me arrange a conversation with people who were at the client at the time.
