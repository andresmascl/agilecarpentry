# Overview

The [Twin Cities LeSS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-LeSS-Twin-Cities/) leadership team has graciously extended an opportunity for me to discuss my experience coaching a LeSS-like transformation within a division of a multi-national networking hardware company on Feburary 16, 2021. Please [sign-up here](https://www.meetup.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-LeSS-Twin-Cities/events/275987580/).

# Synopsis

Join James and his mysterious co-presenter as they present highlights from a LeSS-Huge adoption effort at a large networking and server hardware company. After a quick walk-through of the case study excerpts, James and his co-presenter will focus on participant questions inspired by the extensive diagrams available in the pre-read content.

Colorful information rich context for the discussions is being provided in the many graphics found in the pre-read content. Nuances regarding challenges from executive management changes, clever requirement area boundary definitions, complex engineering challenges, and the political dynamics of a multi-national engineering organization can all be seen in the figures and captions provided in the pre-read content.

# Video

I will post a video of the Zoom meeting here once it is available. In the meantime, you can watch our previous dog Zoe roll over back in Houston.
