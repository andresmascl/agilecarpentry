You can achieve more natural video meetings by using a teleprompter. You will be able to look directly at the video feed of the other meeting participants, while simultaneously looking directly at your own camera. The video carefully explains all the details.

# Incremental Investment Advice

A few people have asked for guidance on where to prioritize your spending to improve your video calls. Please keep in mind that it isn't possible to provide a perfect answer to this question as everyone's office configuration, existing equipment, and personal preferences tend to vary. Yet sometimes imperfect guidance is still better than none at all.

I have included specific hardware recommendations at each investment tier as representative samples. For every piece of equipment I have listed there are lots of great competing choices in the same market niche. This is also a moving target as the equipment choices improve every year, and I only occasionally update this article.

More detailed reference information is available in the _Reference Info_ section below, the one people find a bit overwhelming at times.

## Tier 1: Basic Lighting

Basic lighting improvements. $300

* A pair of edge-lighted panels to clamp to the back of your desk. 
   + [Godox ES45](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1626329-REG/godox_es45_kit_e_sports_es45_led_light.html) or [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)
* Inexpensive daylight balanced bulbs where appropriate to supplement your edge-lighted panels.
   + [Various Alzo LED bulbs](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/products/led-lamps/ci/24485/N/3943306111?filters=fct_brand_name%3Aalzo)
* Ensure your laptop camera or webcam is sitting at eye level.

## Tier 2: Improved Sound

All of the above plus a proper microphone. $350

* Option A: Audio Interface + Basic XLR Microphone: Flexible choice with room for future expansion
  +  [PreSonus Revelator io24 Audio Interface](
      https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1642727-REG/presonus_revelator_io24_desktop_2x4.html)
  + [Shure SM58 Microphone](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/68464-REG/Shure_SM58S_SM58S_Cardioid_Dynamic.html)
   + [Shure A55M Isolation and Swivel Shock Stopper Microphone Mount](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/68624-REG/Shure_A55M_A55M_Isolation_and_Swivel.html)
  + [Kopul Studio Elite 4000 Series Neutrik XLR M to XLR F Microphone Cable (6', Black)](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/845507-REG/Kopul_m4006_Kopul_Studio_Elite_4000.html)
   + [Auray TT-6220 Telescoping Tabletop Microphone Stand](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1023331-REG/auray_tt_6220_telescoping_table_top_mic.html)
   + [Sony MDR-7506 Headphones](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/49510-REG/Sony_MDR_7506_MDR_7506_Headphone.html)

* Option B: USB Microphone: Simplicity without flexibility
  + [PreSonus Revelator USB Mic with Studio Live Vocal Processing](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1594441-REG/presonus_revelator_usb_mic.html)
  + [PreSonus SHK-2 Shockmount for Revelator Microphone](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1694386-REG/presonus_shk_2_shock_mount_for_presonus.html)
  + [Auray TT-6220 Telescoping Tabletop Microphone Stand](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1023331-REG/auray_tt_6220_telescoping_table_top_mic.html)
  + [Sony MDR-7506 Headphones](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/49510-REG/Sony_MDR_7506_MDR_7506_Headphone.html)

I have intentionally listed PreSonus models in both cases since Presonus has a very rich software ecosystem. Each of these options includes a sophisticated sound mixer you access with software on your computer or tablet. By the time you outgrow the functionality of the included mixer, you will no longer be intimidated by more sophisticated mixers such as any of the following: 
* [Mackie DLZ Creator](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1750072-REG/mackie_2053754_00_dlz_creator_advanced_content.html)
* [RODE RODECaster Pro II Integrated Audio Production Studio](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1696424-REG/rode_rcp2_rodecaster_pro_2_podcasting.html)
*  [PreSonus StudioLive 32SC Series III S 32-Channel Subcompact Digital Mixer/Recorder/Interface](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1464988-REG/presonus_studiolive_32sc_compact_32_channel.html)

If you decide on an audio interface and XLR microphone, feel free to pick most any dynamic microphone you like. Curtis Judd's [Part 1: Dynamic Microphones for Podcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX3mgP09St8) video and Podcastage's [12 Best Podcast Microphones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bg1cy8AUvI) videos provide good guidance on microphone choice.

## Tier 3: Teleprompter

All of the above, plus a teleprompter. $300 to $1200

I love my teleprompter so much that I suggest prioritizing a teleprompter over a super fancy camera. A teleprompter with a decent webcam or handicam is likely to improve your ability to connect with your conversational partner(s) in a video call more than a better camera will.

I think a bigger teleprompter screen helps, so I suggest buying a larger rather than smaller teleprompter. The iPad sized models are becoming especially well priced these days, and the iPad Pro sized models are only a little more expensive. Any larger and the price skyrockets. 

The [Elgato Prompter](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/prompter) is particularly tempting, but I still think it is a bit small. Perhaps the best balance of value verses price is a [GlideGear TMP100](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1610382-REG/glide_gear_tmp_100_ipad_smartphone_teleprompter.html) with a [Lilliput FA1016-NP/C 10.1"](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1507742-REG/lilliput_fa1016_np_c_10_1_16_9_lcd_monitor.html). 

If you are a little less price sensitive, I suggest buying the [GlideGear TMP750](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1607037-REG/glide_gear_tmp_750_17_professional.html), using an iPad with [Orion](https://orion.tube/), iPad with [LunaDisplay](https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/), or an iPad sized display monitor. Once the prices drop on the larger dispaly solutions you will be able to upgrade without needing to buy a larger teleprompter.

The optimal solution is likely to be a 2021 or newer iPad Pro running [Orion](https://orion.tube/), placed within an iPad Pro sized teleprompter. Until Orion adds a teleprompter mode, this will require a solution for flipping the display. Perhaps an [UpDownCross Converter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1401679-REG/blackmagic_design_convmudcstd_hd_mini_converter_updowncross_hd.html) would work well. I do not have any hands-on experience with this configuration, and I have not yet heard from anyone who does.

Since my teleprompter video and the _Reference Info_ section focuses so heavily on the teleprompter I won't repeat much of that here.

If you have a really crummy webcam, or none at all, you will need to at least buy some sort of camera to place into the teleprompter. The challenge here is to balance the need to do something that works well enough to start with, verses jumping to a better streaming camera and paying the $500 to $1,500 premium in camera and lens required to do it. 

A google search for "best streaming camera" will show you lots of articles and YouTube videos discussing reasonable choices at different price points. My best advice is to review a few of these articles and videos, and then just ask B&H for guidance.

## Tier 4: Nicer Camera
All of the above, plus a nice camera. $1,200 to $1,500

The simple answer is to just ask [B&H Photo](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/) for advice, and buy what they recommend. Make sure they understand your intention to use your camera in a teleprompter as a webcam.

As of December 2023, you will most likely end up with the full-frame [Canon EOS R8 Mirrorless Camera](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1748813-REG/canon_eos_r8_mirrorless_camera.html) or the [Sony a7 III Mirrorless Camera](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1394217-REG/sony_ilce_7m3_alpha_a7_iii_mirrorless.html). Assuming you don't have a lot of space behind your desk, you will likely end up with a kit zoom lens capable of a 35mm focal length, or perhaps a prime lens somewhere around a 35mm focal length. 

Feeding the camera into your laptop traditionally requires a capture card such as an [Elgato Cam Link 4k](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1453840-REG/elgato_systems_10gam9901_cam_link_4k_game.html) or a hardware video switcher such as an [ATEM Mini Pro](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1557461-REG/blackmagic_design_atem_mini_pro_hdmi.html). With the introduction of _USB Video Class and Audio Class (UVC/UAC)_ support you can avoid the need for a capture card. The [Canon EOS R8 Mirrorless Camera](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1748813-REG/canon_eos_r8_mirrorless_camera.html) and [Sony a7 IV Mirrorless Camera](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1667800-REG/sony_ilce_7m4_b_alpha_a7_iv_mirrorless.html) have UVC/UAC support, but it doesn't seem the slightly older [Sony a7 III Mirrorless Camera](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1394217-REG/sony_ilce_7m3_alpha_a7_iii_mirrorless.html) does.

You will also need a way to supply continuous power to your camera. I recommend asking B&H Photo what is required for whichever camera you select. As an example, my Canon EOS RP requires the [Canon ACK-E18 AC Adapter and DC Coupler Kit](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1274811-REG/canon_0073c002_ac_e6n_ac_adapter_and.html).

I would not spend too much time comparing the nuanced specifications between two similar models from different brands. The more interesting question is which ecosystem you wish to buy into. Do you find one brand has menu systems you like better than the next? Do you find the ergonomics of one brand much better than another? Do you have more faith in the reputation of one brand verses another? Canon, Sony, Nikon, and Panasonic each have their own fans for various reasons. If confused about what to choose, ask B&H Photo for advice and watch a few YouTube videos comparing the models you are considering buying. The more mainstream choice you make, the easier it will be to google for help when you need it. 

If you are living in or visiting Manhattan, consider going to the B&H store in-person. There are a few similar mega-stores scattered throughout the United States and around the globe with competitive pricing, broad selection, and competent staff; but apparently not many have survived the market pressure from online sales.

Assuming your interest is limited to video meetings and perhaps creating a few YouTube videos, you will quickly reach a point of diminishing returns. You can spend far more than $1,500 if you want. The next sweet spot is around $3,000. The one after that around $6,000. Then the prices really start to go to the moon as you get into [cameras used by motion picture professionals](https://www.arri.com/en/camera-systems/cameras). That said, heavily kitted out versions of the [Sony FX3](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1624226-REG/sony_ilme_fx3_fx3_cinema_camera.html) are reportedly [finding their way into professional film production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxi4jfFD5uA) these days.

## Tier 5: Additional Improvements
All of the above, plus whatever else you think makes sense for your needs.

The short list of improvements is likely to include these sorts of things:
* A fancier microphone such as a [Shure SM7B](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/225820-REG/Shure_SM7B_SM7B_Cardioid_Dynamic.html?sts=pi&pim=Y) or [ElectroVoice RE20](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1590184-REG/electro_voice_f_01u_388_793_re20_broadcast_announcer_microphone.html). Make sure to either buy a [CloudLifter CL1 Mic Activator](
https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1177578-REG/cloud_microphones_cl_1_cloudlifter_mic_activator.html) or upgrade to an audio interface with enough gain to handle these gain hungry microphones.
* A secondary camera and hardware based video switcher such as the [ATEM Mini Pro](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1557461-REG/blackmagic_design_atem_mini_pro_hdmi.html). You may want to buy one or two small on-camera monitors such as a [FeelWorld F6 Plus 5.5" 4K HDMI Monitor](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1556369-REG/feelworld_f6plus_f6_plus_5_5_4k.html) to place on your desk and let you more easily monitor your podcast.
* Add a few professional lights. Perhaps one as a rim light, and a couple more to light your backdrop. See _Reference Info_ section for more details.
* A UHF wireless microphone kit such as the [Deity Microphones Theos Digital 2-Person Camera-Mount Wireless Omni Lavalier Microphone System](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1779378-REG/deity_microphones_dtu0253d56_theos_digital_uhf_wireless.html) for use when running around an event interviewing people.
* A set of Pelican, SKB, or Nanuk cases with pick & pluck foam, or perhaps [custom foam](https://mycasebuilder.com/) if traveling with your equipment.


## Other Considerations
Some of the equipment you buy is likely to last decades, other equipment will be replaced over time. There is something to be said for being less price sensitive for the long-lived equipment.

Things that tend to last a very long time:
* Sit stand desk
* Varipoles, super clamps, and similar rigging hardware
* Light and microphone stands
* XLR Microphones
* Teleprompter
* LED lights
* Camera lenses. You marry your lenses and only date your camera body.

Things that will become outdated every half decade or so:
* Better laptop (Macbook Pro, etc.)
* Camera body
* Audio interface
* Capture card

Yet another consideration is your intended usage. If you are going to be creating podcasts with multiple co-located people you will need to look into products such as the [Mackie DLZ](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1750072-REG/mackie_2053754_00_dlz_creator_advanced_content.html) or [RODE RODECaster Pro II](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1696424-REG/rode_rcp2_rodecaster_pro_2_podcasting.html). If you are walking around at a conference filming interviews for your YouTube channel, you will want to invest in a digital pocket recorder. By the time you get this far you will have your own opinions of what to buy, and will likely know more than I do about the topic.


# Reference Info

The equipment shown in the video can be found in the links below. I have also included links to various sound and lighting equipment.

Although this hardware can greatly improve the quality of your remote meetings, don't expect the experience to be as good as in-person can be.

## Teleprompter

### Interesting Teleprompter Choices

* [GlideGear TMP750](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1607037-REG/glide_gear_tmp_750_17_professional.html)
  * This is the teleprompter shown in the video.
  * This GlideGear model will support the larger iPad Pro.
  * When using a full-frame camera, a focal length less than 35mm is likely to show the edges of the teleprompter hood. I would have been just as well off with a 35mm prime lens as I am with my 16mm to 35mm wide angle zoom lens.

* [GlideGear TMP100](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1610382-REG/glide_gear_tmp_100_ipad_smartphone_teleprompter.html)
  * This smaller GlideGear model will only support a standard sized iPad such as the one you see me using in the video.

* [IKan PT Elite Universal Table Teleprompter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1024410-REG/ikan_pt_elite_ul_pt_elite_u_universal_tablet_teleprompter.html)
  * A more expensive iKan model will be better built than the GlideGear models.

* [Prompter People Prompter PAL Desktop Portable Teleprompter](https://prompterpeople.com/prompter-pal-portable-desktop-teleprompter/)
  * This Prompter People model is very tempting.
  * I believe Prompter People and iKan are both very well built, with the iKan brand being just a tad more popular. B&H can advise you better than I can on this.

### Teleprompter Stand

* [iFootage RB-A200 Monopod with round base](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1671052-REG/ifootage_401000087_rb_a200_cobra_2_round.html)
  * Strong enough to handle the weight. 
  * I suggest drilling a few holes in the round base and using wood screws to attach it to a wooden base for better stability.
  * The water bag weight iFootage sells might add enough stablity to make a broad wooden base redundant.

* [One inch thick, 2 foot diamter round board](https://www.homedepot.com/p/1-in-x-2-ft-x-2-ft-Pine-Edge-Glued-Panel-Round-Board-682527/202017012)
  * This is the round board you see me using in the video. I took the time to stain mine to make it look a little better.
  * Most any home center carries these. I believe they are frequently used for making stools.
* [Matthews 1/8" Apple Box](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/99404-REG/Matthews_259538_Eighth_Apple_Box.html)
  * You can use a thinner apple box such as this one as an alternative to the round board I have used.
  * A standard sized apple box is likely to place the top of the iFootage monopod a bit too high.
*  Modified Matthews Telescopic Baby Stand Extension
  * I modified a [Matthews Telescopic Baby Stand Extension](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/33185-REG/Matthews_429499_Telescopic_Baby_Stand_Extension.html) by using a pipe cutter to shorten each telescopic section slightly. You can find my modification instructions in one of the B&H reviews entitled "Modifying Minimum Length".
  * I am using the upside down telescopic baby stand extension in combination with a [Matthews Mounting Plate with 5/8" Receiver](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/33214-REG/Matthews_429621_Mounting_Plate_5_8_Receiver.html) and a [Manfrotto 208 3/8" Head Mounting Plate with Lock Screws](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/554347-REG/Manfrotto_208_208_3_8_Head_Mounting.html).
  *  Since the small 1/4"-20 t-handle knob nearest the Manfroto mounting plate was hitting the mounting plate, I replaced it with a standard hex head 1/4"-20 bolt. 
  *  The [iFootage RB-A200 monopod](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1671052-REG/ifootage_401000087_rb_a200_cobra_2_round.html) should be a better choice than what I am using. I wasn't aware of the iFootage RB-200 at the time I created my solution.
  
* [Punks Corey Tripod Range by 3LeggedThing](https://www.3leggedthing.com/us/tripod-ranges/punks.html)
  * If you decide to place a tripod behind your desk, the Punks range made by 3 Legged Thing are well priced choices which can handle the weight.

### Luna Display

* [Luna Display](https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/)
  * The LunaDisplay has the “teleprompter” mode you need. Unfortunately, Apple Sidecar doesn't currently have this feature.
  * Dedicated teleprompter monitors do not have the high resolution you need for Zoom meetings, although they are bright. 
  * Production monitors have the required resolution, but are seldom as bright as an iPad.
  * An iPad running Orion or a dedicated production monitor might be a better solution than a LunaDisplay.

### iPad running Orion

The [Orion HDMI iPad application](https://orion.tube/) by LUX looks likely to be a better iPad based solution than the Luna Display. 

The iPad screens are far brighter than the reasonably priced display monitors. The reasonably priced production monitors are listed as having anywhere from 300 to 400 nits of brightness. In comparison, various generations of iPad displays range from 600 nits on the low end, to as high as 1000 nits. A friend is using a [Lilliput 10.1" FA1016/C IPS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XBPD5BF) in his iPad sized teleprompter. He is generally happy with his purchase, but wishes it was brighter.

I don't think Orion currently supports a teleprompter mode, although I put in a feature request in hopes they will add it. In the meantime, perhaps an [UpDownCross Converter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1401679-REG/blackmagic_design_convmudcstd_hd_mini_converter_updowncross_hd.html) would work well.

### Broadcast Monitor Display Alternatives

Most of the time the LunaDisplay works well. Occasionally, the image quality degrades for whatever reason. Unplugging and re-plugging the USB-C cable typically fixes the problem.

In the future I am tempted to try a hardware only solution. Any of the following broadcast monitors with image flip capabilities might be a good choice. I have not tested any of these choices. If anyone has experience with this sort of approach, please let me know what hardware you are using and how it is working for you.

* [FeelWorld P133-9HSD 13.3" Broadcast IPS LCD Monitor](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1251100-REG/feelworld_fwp133_9hsd_13_3_pro_broadcast_lcd.html)

* [Laizeske 13.3" Full HD IPS Multi-format Pro HDMI Broadcast LCD Monitor](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1371658-REG/laizeske_lzedr133h_13_3_aluminum_design_ips.html)

* [Lilliput A12 12.5" 4K Monitor](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1366917-REG/lilliput_a12_12_5_4k_broadcast.html)

Another option would be a [portable monitor](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/portable-monitors/ci/48139) coupled with an [UpDownCross Converter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1401679-REG/blackmagic_design_convmudcstd_hd_mini_converter_updowncross_hd.html) of some sort.




## Lighting

* [Various Alzo LED bulbs](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/products/led-lamps/ci/24485/N/3943306111?filters=fct_brand_name%3Aalzo)
  * Just replacing all the lights in your office with daylight balanced bulbs will go a very long way. As long as all the lights are the same color temperature the camera’s automatic mode will work much better. This is just as true of standard webcams as it is of the fancy mirrorless cameras.
* [Godox ES45](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1626329-REG/godox_es45_kit_e_sports_es45_led_light.html)
  * I have two of these edge lighted panels mounted at the back of my desk. One as a key light, and one as a fill light. These two Godox ES45 in combination with a Godox S60 serving as a backlight, and another Godox S60 lighting the backdrop consititute a [four point lighting setup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_lighting).
* [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light)
  * This is Elgato's version of the Godox ES45.

* [Godox UL60](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1621579-REG/godox_ul60_silent_led_video.html)
  * I didn't buy this light since it didn't have the focusing flood attachment I needed in my application, yet I love that it is completely silent with no fan.
* [Godox S60](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1618069-REG/godox_s60_led_focusing_light.html)
  * I have two of these. I use one as a backlight light. The other I have pointed at my backdrop.
  * I have found the fan noise completely unimportant in my case. My horribly lound air conditioner vent and portable fan make far more noise than fans in these lights ever will.
* [Godox CS50D Collapsible Lantern Softbox](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1647902-REG/godox_cs50d_lantern_softbox.html)
  * There are a myriad combinations of soft boxes and other approaches for a nice soft light for your key and fill light. Softboxes are bulky and take up space, but they likely produce better lighting results than the edge lighted LED panels I am using.
* [Impact Safety Cable](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1020057-REG/impact_sc_1815_safety_cable_1_5mm.html)
  * I have a safety cable such as this one on each of the two Godox S60 lights I have mounted on a cross bar near the ceiling.


### Light Stand Alternative

* [Impact Baby Pin Wall Plate](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1305586-REG/impact_srp_115p_3_baby_pin_wall.html)
  * A baby pin plate can be a good choice for mounting lights without stands when you don’t mind attaching things to walls.
  * Pick whatever configuration of baby pin plate fits your needs best.
* [Impact Deluxe Varipole Support System](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/822851-REG/Impact_VP_712BP_Deluxe_Varipole_Support_System_2.html?sts=pi&pim=Y)
	* A telescoping pole such as this one will give you something to mount to without having light stands under your feet everywhere. You can get two of them and put a cross bar between them as I did.
	* B&H will give you lots of light stands by default, which is probably not what you want for a home office. Light stands are very flexible for professional photographer types, but I assume your primary interest is routine Zoom meetings.
	* I am learning I would benefit from the flexiblity of having a few light stands when making YouTube videos. That said, for normal Zoom meetings I still prefer to avoid the need for light stands.
	* This is getting into ask for advice from B&H territory. 
	
* [Impact Super Clamp with Ratchet Handle](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/824360-REG/impact_cc_106r_super_clamp_with_ratchet.html?sts=pi&pim=Y)
  * A "super clamp" is a staple of photographic equipment. My Godox S60 lights and their ballasts are attached to my varipoles and cross bar using super clamps and baby pins.
  * This standard type of clamp is produced by a large number of brands. They all take a "baby pin", and also have a few useful threaded holes you can use when attaching things.

## Cameras

Cameras get tricky. There are lots of great choices.

The simple answer is to just ask [B&H Photo](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/) for advice, and buy what they recommend. Make sure they understand your intention to use your camera in a teleprompter as a webcam.

The sort of image quality you get from most any proper camera will be much better than what you get from a webcam built into your laptop.

If you want to search online, the main places for advice all seem to come from one of three places:
* Gamers who stream video of themselves playing video games
* YouTube content producers
* People involved in A/V for houses of worship (Churches/Temples/etc.)

If you have a kid who is into YouTube stuff, just ask them to do the research for you.

* [Elgato Camera Check](https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link/camera-check)
  * Great place to check whether a camera will work well and avoid overheating. Most people end up with either a Sony A7 something camera or a Cannon EOS RP mirrorless camera.
  * This is a useful guide even if you don't buy any Elgato hardware.
  
* [Canon EOS RP Mirrorless Camera](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1459282-REG/canon_eos_rp_mirrorless_digital.html)
  * The RP is the camera body I have.
  * The [Canon EOS R8](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1748813-REG/canon_eos_r8_mirrorless_camera.html) is the new model which fills the same spot in the Canon product line the RP previously filled.

  * The kit lens included here will probably work well in the telemprompter setup I have described. Ask B&H to be certain.

  * You will need some sort of capture card in most cases if you want the best resolution. Canon’s webcam utility works, but the resolution isn’t as good as with a capture card of some sort.

  * I ended up buying an ATEM Mini just in case I eventually decide to add a second camera. Now that the ATEM Mini Pro has come down greatly in price, I recommend you consider buying it instead.

## Sound

There are multitude of great sound equipment choices. Everything I have read says a dynamic microphone is much better in a noisy untreated room than a condenser microphone. 

Condenser microphones pick up more nuances, but they also have less aggressive cardioid pickup patterns which tend to pick up everything in a room.

This topic is a whole can of worms. The best relevant YouTube channel I have found for advice is Curtis Judd's [Learn Light and Sound](https://www.youtube.com/c/curtisjudd).

I ended up buying an ElectroVoice RE20.

* [ElectroVoice RE20](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1590184-REG/electro_voice_f_01u_388_793_re20_broadcast_announcer_microphone.html)
  * This is the ElectroVoice RE20 I ended up buying. It initially [came to market in 1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro-Voice_RE20).

* [Shure SM7B](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/225820-REG/Shure_SM7B_SM7B_Cardioid_Dynamic.html?sts=pi&pim=Y)
  * The Shure SM7B is another very popular choice. It initially [came to market in 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shure_SM7).

In retrospect I probably would have been just as well served with either of the two $100 models below:
* [Shure SM58](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/68464-REG/Shure_SM58S_SM58S_Cardioid_Dynamic.html)
* [Sennheiser e835](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/149269-REG/Sennheiser_E835_E835_Cardioid_Handheld.html)

If you use a gain hungry microphone such as the RE20 or SM7B you will likely need a microphone activator (in-line preamp) such as a [CloudLifter CL1 Mic Activator](
https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1177578-REG/cloud_microphones_cl_1_cloudlifter_mic_activator.html)

An advantage of the Shure SM58 and Sennheiser e835 is they are not as gain hungry as the SM7B or RE20 and therefore won’t require spending money on a mic activator. Curtis Judd has a great [video comparing the SM7B to the SM58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPAKlk1Tt-I) for livestream and podcasting use.

My audio interface is a [PreSonus Revelator io24](
https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1642727-REG/presonus_revelator_io24_desktop_2x4.html). Although the audio processing is done on the PreSonus hardware, the internal mixer is mostly controlled remotely using either a desktop or iPad application. This has been wonderful in allowing me to get help from my friends with more sound experience than myself. For example, a friend in Canada was able to help me adjust my settings over a Zoom call in which I was sharing my screen.

## Desk

I have been very happy with my [VertDesk v3](
https://www.btod.com/search-results?p=catalog&mode=search&search_in=all&search_str=vertdesk+v3) sold by BTOD. Mine is a 30" x 72" Plus model with two motors. I am extremely glad I bought the wire management tray, without which the wires on my desk would be even more out of control. 

I also purchased the castors which have been extremely helpful when I need to get to the back of my desk. Making more involved camera setting adjustments would be much harder if I couldn't easily roll my desk away from the wall.
