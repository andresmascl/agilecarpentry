Adopting a LeSS-like structure drastically mitigated the perpetual existential threat to around a billion dollars of annual revenue at a large server hardware company.

Following on the heels of [an earlier success]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/hundreds-of-millions-saved/), I helped restructure a large number of teams responsible for bringing up and integrating each new generation of Intel CPU within a blade computing product.

In collaboration with the relevant senior director I facilitated a correction of the organizational issues, and the attendant engineering and cultural issues which had historically necessitated an army of engineers over a year to integrate each new generation of Intel CPU.

Any failure to successfully integrate the newest server grade Intel CPU generation prior to each Intel CPU launch would result in a threat to around a billion dollars of annual sales revenue. A failure would mean missing the ability to participate in Intel launch announcements, reputational damage, and lost sales to competing products.

__Integrating future generations of Intel CPU are expected to take an eighth of the calendar time, and an eighth of the engineering effort that had historically been required.__


# Validating The Business Benefits

The best way to validate the claims above is to have me arrange a conversation with people who were at the client at the time.
