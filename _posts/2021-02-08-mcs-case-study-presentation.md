# Overview

The [Twin Cities LeSS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-LeSS-Twin-Cities/) leadership team graciously extended an opportunity for me to discuss my experience coaching a LeSS-like transformation within a division of a multi-national networking hardware company. The event listing can be found [here](https://www.meetup.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-LeSS-Twin-Cities/events/275987580/). The recorded Zoom meeting and relevant pre-read handouts are available below.

# Synopsis

Join James and his mysterious co-presenter as they present highlights from a LeSS-Huge adoption effort at a large networking and server hardware company. After a quick walk-through of the case study excerpts, James and his co-presenter will focus on participant questions inspired by the extensive diagrams available in the pre-read content.

Colorful information rich context for the discussions is being provided in the many graphics found in the pre-read content. Nuances regarding challenges from executive management changes, clever requirement area boundary definitions, complex engineering challenges, and the political dynamics of a multi-national engineering organization can all be seen in the figures and captions provided in the pre-read content.

# Zoom Chat Log

**Samuel Brisson:** the LeSS site has some general notes on the  feature team adoption map - [https://less.works/less/adoption/feature-team-adoption_map](https://less.works/less/adoption/feature-team-adoption_map) I like how James' case study interprets this for the teams they were working with in context of the product

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** I think domains like firmware where it’s believed agile isn’t appropriate ought to be challenged - in some cases, I bet there are good reasons and in others, I’d bet there’s potential to work incrementally / feedback-driven / etc. but it just hasn’t been tried / given a chance.

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** Interesting to see HW VP more onboard than SW VP

**Samuel Brisson:** Joel, I agree - adaptiveness is a 'keystone' that seems to unlock so many other aspects of high value delivery

**Bill Asch:** HW VPs get the cost of rework... (my personal  experience at Intel...9+ years)

**David Nielsen:** Logging questions and comments, keep them coming!

**Julian Johnson:** How did this team structure evolution tie in with the training to Bios Teams, specifically in helping to resolve "a few key team dysfunctions"?

**David Nielsen :** Q1:How did this team structure evolution tie in with the training to Bios Teams, specifically in helping to resolve "a few key team dysfunctions"?

**Samuel Brisson :** For Mitya: In retrospect, were there any key economic elements of this product that the Adoption strategy could have connected to more directly as a part of the product / tech team partnership?

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** I’m curious what kind of training teams get before they change into a more Less-like way of working.  I’m currently using Seattle Scrum Company’s video-based training to train very basic Scrum concepts, am assuming coaches and POs get training but I’m less (pun) sure about what kind of training to offer for Devs.  3-day LeSS practitioner training sounds like a big ask.

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA :** Yes, and …

**Samuel Brisson:** [Larman’s Laws of Organizational Behavior](https://less.works/less/structure/index)

**Julian Johnson:** What might be done differently with the communications with, or around the new SVP/GM?  Wondering if there any retro on if any incremental steps that could've been taken up each layer of the org chart.

**David Nielsen:** [https://less.works/trainers/craig-larman-as-a-trainer-8/courses](https://less.works/trainers/craig-larman-as-a-trainer-8/courses)

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA :** We’re going to get about 50 people through 3-day LeSS training w/Michael James next month - including our CEO, directors, managers, POs, PMs, coaches, etc.

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA :** That’s about 30% of our company

**Jerry Lopez :** That is EXCELLENT!!!!!!

**Samuel Brisson:** @Joel - huge win!  that's a big deal

**Jerry Lopez:** MJ is an awesome guy.  Really like him.

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA :** about 60% have finished his Scrum Training Series

**Jerry Lopez :** You are on track to something great.! Well Done!!

**Walt Paulson :** That is a GREAT first step to get a large mixed group!!!

**David Nielsen :** Q3: For Mitya: In retrospect, were there any key economic elements of this product that the Adoption strategy could have connected to more directly as a part of the product / tech team partnership

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA :** I’d like to explore the “adoption vs transformation” spectrum - James’ comments about the change sounded kind of…abrupt

**David Nielsen :** Q4: (Julian) What might be done differently with the communications with, or around the new SVP/GM?  Wondering if there any retro on if any incremental steps that could've been taken up each layer of the org chart.

**Vladimir Bushin :** and what actually happened when a new VP came?

**Vladimir Bushin:** not everybody believed in Scrum?

**Vladimir Bushin:** what new VP was looking for?

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** I think that’s the hardest part of the job — winning the hearts and minds of hard-headed managers (I’m using that term instead of ‘leadership’ intentionally).

**David Nielsen:** Q5: (Joel) I’d like to explore the “adoption vs transformation” spectrum - James’ comments about the change sounded kind of…abrupt

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** Regarding retaining/empowering the SW VP, I’m reminded of this quote: “"We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them." — Albert Einstein

**Jeff Hove:** Did the project eventually get completed, or did the whole product-line fail?

**Nissa Eberly:** Hi All need to jump. Thank you.

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** Feature lead times

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** blood / effort = priority

**Vladimir Bushin :** was there something measured routinely every sprint besides number of bugs and velocity?

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA :** Cost of delay > bug-free quality

**Vladimir Bushin:** how frequently have you released a new version to production?

**Joel Robinson - Redmond WA:** they’re still in business because they didn’t do all those things :-)

**Vladimir Bushin:** great session, thank you so much!

**Vladimir Bushin:** thank you for sharing your experience and helping us learn

**Jeff Hove:** Very interesting.  Thanks.

**Walt Paulson:** Outstanding conversations!!! Thanks
