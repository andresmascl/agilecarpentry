# Introduction

Agile Carpentry is the corporate entity through which James Carpenter provides agile consulting services. It is setup as an S-corp with a small but efficient back office infrastructure. This provides the following features:
+ Liability insurance
+ Compliance with all state and federal corporate filing requirements
+ Compliance with federal employment taxes
+ Compliance with multiple state employment taxes
This keeps your back office happy, so you can easily on-board James to help you.
Agile Carpentry also employs a professional accounting firm and a national full-service payroll company to help ensure all this goes smoothly regardless of which state or country James must travel to as a W2 employee of Agile Carpentry. This allows James to focus on his clients during the week, and on his family during the weekend.
