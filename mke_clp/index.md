# Course Agenda

The morning of the first of three days will be used to establish the overall context of the system modeling activities which follow. This will be done through a small amount of lecture, combined with both small and large group discussions.

Once the stage is set, we will transition to thoughtful analysis of the impact of different organizational design decisions on adaptability and value delivery using system modeling. Following each incremental framework agnostic advance in our understanding, we will map concrete aspects of LeSS into our increasingly enlightened understanding of organizational system dynamics. The system modeling brings deeper insight, while mapping this insight into LeSS facilitates better retention along with an understanding of how to act on what is being learned.

We will continue to incrementally advance our depth of understanding using system modeling for the majority of the three days. Towards the end of the third day time will be spent: coalescing the whole of our enhanced understanding; providing guidance on how to move forward; and orienting participants on how to navigate a wealth of additional information.

## DAY 1: Setting the Stage

The first of three days will be used to establish the overall context of the system modeling activities which follow. This will be done with a small amount of lecture, but primarily via small and large group discussions and exercises. Weâ€™ll follow this thread through the entire 3-day event.

- Introduction
- Avoiding Taylorism
- Estimates, not Commitments
- People are Valuable
- System Optimization, not Local Optimization
- Discovering Value
- Implications of multiple Product Backlogs

## DAY 2: Seeing Simplicity through Systems Modeling

On the second day, we will take what we learned about Systems Modeling on Day 1 and use those tools to understand:

- Benefits of Cross-Functional Teams
- Product Breadth Considerations
- Private Code Impedes Technical Excellence
- Managing Cognitive Fullness
- Requirement Area Sizing Considerations

## DAY 3: Modeling decisions through Systems Modeling & LeSS

As we continue to advance our depth of understanding using system modeling, the third day will be spent coalescing the whole of our enhanced understanding, providing guidance on how to move forward, and orienting participants on how to navigate a wealth of additional information.

- Product Breadth and Adaptability
- Avoiding Middlemen
- LeSS Complete Picture
- Structure Drives Culture
- Adoption in your organization
- Extended Q&A

# After course completion

Each participant will be a Certified LeSS Practitioner and will get an account on less.works. Here one can find additional information about LeSS, share course information, and stay in contact with the other course participants.

All participants get access to the book: _Large-Scale Scrum: More with LeSS_

# Travel Logistics

The Milwaukee training venue is in a walkable neighborhood less than a 5 minute Uber ride from the [downtown and Third Ward hotels]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/mke_clp/hotel). If you fly in or arrive by train you won't need to bother with a rental car.

If you live in the MidWest you may find [taking the train]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/mke_clp/train) or driving to be a nice low-stress option.

Your options for [traveling by plane]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/mke_clp/plane) include both the Milwaukee Mitchell airport as well as the Chicago O'Hare airport.

See the following pages for additional travel details:
* [Hotels and nearby Dining and Shopping]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/mke_clp/hotel)
* [Travel by Train]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/mke_clp/train)
* [Travel by Plane]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/mke_clp/plane)

# Training Venue Details

The expected training venue is an upscale event room on the Upper East Side of Milwaukee, overlooking Lake Michigan. This is in a more residential urban neighborhood. There are lots of walkable restaurants, grocery stores, and an amazing park system; but no hotels. There is all-day paid parking available nearby.

## Training Venue Address

* *Photos: Walking from Parking:* Multiple photos taken along the walking routes from parking. This includes photos of the various parking rate signs and parking kiosks.

# Meal Information

Breakfast, lunch, snack breaks, coffee, and the like are all included.

For lunch we will most likely walk as a group to one of the table service restaurants shown in the custom map above. For the sake of variety, I am expecting to pre-arrange lunch at a different restaurant each day. By communicating your menu selections a little in advance, the restaurants will be ready for us when we arrive.

This approach to lunch will provide us with a mid-day change of scenery, let us stretch our legs a little, and hopefully provide more opportunity to get to know each other a little better.

The three best walkable restaurant options with table service available to us are:
* [Maru Korean Bistro](https://www.marukoreanmke.com/)
* [Good City Brewing](https://www.goodcitybrewing.com/locations/east-side/)
* [Comet Cafe](https://www.thecometcafe.com/lunch-dinner)

A forth potential choice is [Stone Bowl Grill](https://www.stonebowlgrill.com/). Stone Bowl is a bit more of a dive than the other three places, but the food and service are good.

Please let me know of any food restrictions so I can make appropriate accomodations.

# Your Input Matters

This will be a small class with no more than fifteen participants. This should result in a better learning experience for everyone. It also provides us with a bit more flexiblity than is practical with a larger group.

Please [email me](mailto:james@agilecarpentry.com) with any questions you may have. Similarly, feel free to provide any constructive guidance you think appropriate.
