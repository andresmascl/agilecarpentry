# Travel Logistics

## Ariving By Air
[Denver International Airport](https://www.flydenver.com/) is the third largest airport in the nation. Since it is a hub airport for [United Airlines](https://www.united.com/), there is usually a non-stop flight on United available from most anywhere in the United States.

The [Denver Airport Rail](https://www.denver.org/about-denver/transportation/denver-airport-rail/) makes it very easy to get back and forth between the airport and downtown. The ride takes 37 minutes and departs from the airport rail terminal every 20 minutes. There are several [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg2NzlTpcAY) which show how easy it is.

## Ariving By Amtrak

![Denver Union Station](/assets/images/clp/Denver_union_station.jpg)

A [Roomette](https://www.amtrak.com/onboard/onboard-accommodations-for-all-your-needs/sleeper-car-accommodations/roomettes.html) on the [Amtrak California Zephyr](https://www.amtrak.com/california-zephyr-train) is a particularly low-stress option which will let you watch the countryside roll by. Here is a YouTube [video showing what it is like to ride the California Zephyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1gRPEZdKyI). A traditional printable  [schedule for the California Zephyr](https://www.railpassengers.org/site/assets/files/20928/california-zephyr.pdf) is sometimes quicker to read than the Amtrak website.

Union Station is in the middle of downtown Denver and within walking distance of every event venue being considered. It is likely I will be taking the California Zephyr in a Roomette myself on either my outbound or return trip from Milwaukee to Denver.

Going across the country on Amtrak works best if you are able to avoid any connections aside from those with frequent commuter lines.


# Training Venue Details

Event venue selection is heavily influenced by both logistical and hosting cost constraints. The hotels below have made the short list.

* [Hotel Teatro](https://www.hotelteatro.com/): A very pretty 4 star boutique hotel in a historic building in downtown Denver. This hotel is not affiliated with any of the large hotel chains.
* [The Curtis (A Doubletree Hotel By Hilton)](https://www.thecurtis.com/): A very artistic 4 star hotel. The beds look comfortable, and they have a lot of event space.
* [Hyatt Place](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-place/denzd-hyatt-place-denver-downtown): Upscale limited service 3 star hotel. Possible back-up option.
* [Hilton Garden Inn](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/denddgi-hilton-garden-inn-denver-downtown/): Upscale limited service 3 star hotel. Possible back-up option.
* [Home 2 By Hilton](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/dentiht-home2-suites-denver-downtown-convention-center/): Limited service 3 star hotel. Possible back-up option.

I am expecting event space pricing for the Hotel Teatro and The Curtis to be cost effective with a smaller class size. If I am wrong about pricing or if we need more date options, one of the back-up options will do the trick.

If you are going to be paying for a hotel room using points, it is likely you will find a hotel within your desired frequent traveler program within walking distance of the event hotel. Nothing is easier than staying in the same hotel as the event itself.

# Lunches Will Be Great

Lunch will be provided, most likely at nearby table service restaurants. This will provide a better social experience for everyone, and allow us to spend some time outside of the event space.

Breakfast will also be provided. I anticipate we will be eating as a group at the event hotel restaurant each morning, or some similar arrangement.
