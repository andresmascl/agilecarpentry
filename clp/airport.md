# Weekend Certified LeSS Practitioner

For those of you working in a contract capacity, the loss of billable time during the work week is often a greater concern than the cost of the course itself. This time compressed Certified LeSS Practitioner course is designed with you in mind.

Unlike a normal 3-day course with 8 hour days, the course will be compressed into only two 12 hour days and run at an on-airport location or extremely close by. 

By limiting the venues to only include those walk-able from airport security, you will be able to fly-in Friday evening and walk directly to your hotel room. Similarly, you will be able to roll out of your hotel bed early Monday morning and be at the airport security checkpoint only moments later. With a non-stop outbound flight, you are likely to be at your client's office by at least mid-morning.

Full attendance will still be required, although everything possible will be done to make the long days as painless as possible. Unless you are willing to take a red-eye flight Sunday night, you will most likely need to book your hotel room through to Monday morning.

Considering the long training days, I fully expect to have the hotel provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It is likely a late dinner will be the celebratory ending to each long day.

I will be shocked if I am able to provide any significant discounts for this course. This course is being optimized to minimize attendee overall cost by minimizing the loss of billable weekday hours. This is expected to come at the cost of a higher price for the course itself. For a more typical mid-week Certified LeSS Practitioner course please see my other course listings.

# Venue Details

The exact choice of hotel and venue will depend on where pre-registered attendees are based, and which on-airport hotels have availability with workable pricing. 

The constraint of keeping non-stop flights short for both east and west coast attendees results in the short list below. I have already requested tentative weekend pricing from each of these venues for March 20 to March 21. 

* [Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL)](https://www.atl.com/)
  + [Marriott Gateway Hotel](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/atlma-atlanta-airport-marriott-gateway/overview/)
  + [Renaissance Atlanta Airport Gateway](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/atlag-renaissance-atlanta-airport-gateway-hotel/overview/)
  + [SpringHill Suites Gateway](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/atlgi-springhill-suites-atlanta-airport-gateway/overview/)
  + Notes:
    + All of the above hotels are accessed via the [airport tram](https://martaguide.com/things-to-know-about-the-atlanta-skytrain/).
    + ATL is the largest airport hub in the nation.
    + ATL is a primary hub for Delta Airlines.

* [Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)](https://www.dfwairport.com/)
  + [Hyatt Grand at Terminal D](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/texas/grand-hyatt-dfw/dfwgh)
  + [Hyatt Regency at Terminal C](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/texas/hyatt-regency-dfw-international-airport/dfwap)
  + Notes:
    + The Hyatt Grand is the more luxurious and more expensive of of the two hotels. I have stayed at both.
    + DFW is the second largest hub in the nation. 
    + DFW is a primary hub for American Airlines.
    + The Gaylord Texan is only a short Uber ride away from the airport.

* [Denver International Airport (DEN)](https://www.flydenver.com/)
  + [Westin Denver International Airport](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/denaw-the-westin-denver-international-airport/overview/)
  + Notes:
    + One of my favorite on-airport hotels given the very cool architecture and nice Westin beds. I have stayed here several times when I missed a connecting flight.
    + The Gaylord Rockies is only a short Uber ride away from the airport.
    + Denver is a bit far for any east coast participants.
    + DEN is the third largest hub in the nation. 
    + DEN is a primary hub for United Airlines.

* [Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)](https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/home/pages/default.aspx)
  + [Hilton Chicago O'Hare Airport](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/chiohhh-hilton-chicago-ohare-airport/)
  + Notes:
    + I have never had to spend the night at this Hilton, but I have had lunch in the lobby. The hotel is nothing special, but it is on-brand for an airport Hilton.
    + ORD is the fourth largest hub in the nation.
    + ORD is a primary hub for United Airlines, and a major hub for American Airlines.

* Slightly smaller centrally located hub airports such as Detroit (DTW), Minneapolis (MSP), and Nashville (BNA) may also be workable based on where pre-registered participants happen to be based and what non-stop flights are available.

# Venue Specifics May Differ From Design Intent

The above vision explains the intent. Once all the pricing and venue research is done, it is possible a very near airport resort venue such as one of the Gaylord Hotels a short Uber ride from DFW or DEN will be more sensible.

# Agenda Tweak
Aside from the contents of Day 2 being split between Day 1 and Day 3, the standard agenda applies.
