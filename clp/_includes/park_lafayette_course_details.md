# Travel Logistics

The Milwaukee training venue is in a walkable neighborhood less than a 5 minute Uber ride from the [downtown and Third Ward hotels]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/mke/hotel). If you fly in or arrive by train you won't need to bother with a rental car.

If you live in the Midwest you may find [taking the train]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/mke/train) or driving to be a nice low-stress option.

Your options for [traveling by plane]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/mke/plane) include both the Milwaukee Mitchell airport as well as the Chicago O'Hare airport.

# Training Venue Details

The expected training venue is an upscale event room on the Upper East Side of Milwaukee, overlooking Lake Michigan. This is in a more residential urban neighborhood. There are lots of walkable restaurants, grocery stores, and an amazing park system; but no hotels. There is all-day paid parking available nearby.

# Meal Information

Breakfast, lunch, snack breaks, coffee, and the like are all included.

For lunch we will most likely walk as a group to one of the table service restaurants shown in the custom map above. For the sake of variety, I am expecting to pre-arrange lunch at a different restaurant each day. By communicating your menu selections a little in advance, the restaurants will be ready for us when we arrive.

This approach to lunch will provide us with a mid-day change of scenery, let us stretch our legs a little, and hopefully provide more opportunity to get to know each other a little better.

The three best walkable restaurant options with table service available to us are:
* [Maru Korean Bistro](https://www.marukoreanmke.com/)
* [Good City Brewing](https://www.goodcitybrewing.com/locations/east-side/)
* [Comet Cafe](https://www.thecometcafe.com/lunch-dinner)

A forth potential choice is [Stone Bowl Grill](https://www.stonebowlgrill.com/). Stone Bowl is a bit more of a dive than the other three places, but the food and service are good.

Please let me know of any food restrictions so I can make appropriate accomodations.

# Your Input Matters

This will be a small class with no more than fifteen participants. This should result in a better learning experience for everyone. It also provides us with a bit more flexiblity than is practical with a larger group.

Please [email me](mailto:james@agilecarpentry.com) with any questions you may have. Similarly, feel free to provide any constructive guidance you think appropriate.
