# Weekend Scheduling

This course has been specifically designed to minimize the loss of billable time for participants.

For people living in any of the following areas, it should be trivial to attend without losing any billable time other than Friday.
* Greater Milwaukee, WI
* Greater Madison, WI
* Greater Chicago, IL

Flying-in is also extremely reasonable for most people in the United States and parts of Canada. If you can't find a non-stop flight into Milwaukee's super easy [Mitchell International Airport](https://www.mitchellairport.com/) and don't have time for a connection, you will likely be able to fly non-stop into Chicago O'Hare. A few moments after starting your rental car at O'Hare you will be out of the city and cruising north on Interstate 41 through the scenic country side. You will arrive at your downtown Milwaukee hotel just over an hour later.

For those of you on a tight schedule who are flying, staging yourself at the [on-aiport Hilton at Chicago O'Hare](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/chiohhh-hilton-chicago-ohare-airport/) on Sunday night will let you catch an early non-stop flight back home on Monday morning. The money you save by returning your rental car early, will easily pay for the slightly higher premium of spending your last night a few steps away from the security checkpoint.

For those of you doing contract work, the money you save by minimizing lost billable time should easily compensate for any travel cost and the lack of heavy course discounts.
