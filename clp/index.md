# Overview

In early 2023 I will be going on the road to deliver a Certified LeSS Practitioner course to all of the cities below.

As soon as a course obtains enough pre-registrations to become financially viable, I will finalize the venue details, process all pre-registration credit cards, and raise the price.

# Suggested Actions

If any of these locations is particularly compelling to you, I strongly suggest you do the following:
* Pre-register ASAP to take advantage of the pre-registration discount.
* Encourage your friends and peers to pre-register as well to ensure the course reaches critical mass.

# Pre-Registrations Are Transferable to Other Locations

If you pre-register for a course which fails to reach critical mass, you will be given an option to attend a later course as long as capacity allows. For example, if you pre-register for Washington DC and the Washington DC course fails to reach critical mass, you can choose to transfer your pre-registration to Florida where you can enjoy a little warm weather.
