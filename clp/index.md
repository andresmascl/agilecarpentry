As soon as a course obtains enough pre-registrations to become financially viable, I will finalize the venue details, and process all pre-registration credit cards.

# Pre-Registrations Are Transferable to Other Locations

With any course which fails to reach critical mass, your card on file will never be charged.

You will typically be given an option to attend a later course as long as capacity allows. For example, if you pre-register for Altanta and the Atlanta course fails to reach critical mass, you can choose to transfer your pre-registration to another upcoming location.
