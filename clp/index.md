# Overview

In early 2023 I will be going on the road to deliver a Certified LeSS Practitioner course to all of the cities below.

As soon as a course obtains enough pre-registrations to become financially viable, I will finalize the venue details, process all pre-registration credit cards, and raise the price.

# Suggested Actions

If any of these locations is particularly compelling to you, I strongly suggest you do the following:
* Pre-register ASAP to take advantage of the pre-registration discount.
* Encourage your friends and peers to pre-register as well to ensure the course reaches critical mass.

# Pre-Registrations Are Transferable to Other Locations

With any course which fails to reach critical mass, your card on file will never be charged.

You will typically be given an option to attend a later course as long as capacity allows. For example, if you pre-register for Washington DC and the Washington DC course fails to reach critical mass, you can choose to transfer your pre-registration to another upcoming location.

* Milwaukee, WI, USA: January 24-26, 2022: Delivered
