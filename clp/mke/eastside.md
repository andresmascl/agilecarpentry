# Upper East Side Event Venue Details

Agile Carpentry has an upscale event room on the _Upper East Side_ of Milwaukee, overlooking Lake Michigan. This is in a more residential urban neighborhood. There are lots of walkable restaurants, grocery stores, an amazing park system, and a wonderful trail system; but no hotels. Fortunately, the _Downtown_ hotels are very close by.

# Oak Leaf Trail To/From Downtown Hotels

In pleasant weather, the [Oak Leaf Trail](https://county.milwaukee.gov/EN/Parks/Explore/Trails/Oak-Leaf-Trail){:target="_blank"} provides a great way to travel between the [Downtown hotels]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/mke/hotel){:target="_blank"} and the _Upper East Side_ event venue.

Using the recently built _Downtown Westin Milwaukee_ as an example starting location, the travel times along Oak Leaf Trail to the _Upper East Side_ event venue are as follows:
* Walking: 37 minutes
* Bicycle: 11 minutes
* Scooter: 11 minutes

## Consider Packing A Bicycle Helmet

Bicycle helmets are not legally required, but they are always a good idea. Consider packing one.

Here are a few folding bicycle helmet models.

## Bublr Ride-Share Bicycles

The urban portions of Milwaukee have Bublr ride-share bicycles every few blocks.

Milwaukee has a very extensive trail system. This includes some pretty trails along Lake Michigan. You can [explore the trail system](https://county.milwaukee.gov/EN/Parks/Explore/Trails){:target="_blank"} on the Milwaukee County Parks website.

Although riding a bicycle on the sidewalk is technically illegal, this rule is only loosely enforced. If you are riding slowly and considerately along the sidewalks it is very unlikely you will encounter any problems. In many places the trail system and the sidewalks are the same. 

If you are racing along the sidewalk, as you dream of riding in the _Tour de France_, don't be surprised if the police stop you.

## Dockless Electric Scooters

![Dockless Electric Scooter Ride-Shares](/assets/images/clp/electric_scooters.jpeg)

Every spring the dockless electric scooters start showing up. Each vendor has their own mobile application for showing where to find a nearby scooter. Technically people are supposed to park them in designated spots, but no one does.

These are fast enough that police are more likely to enforce the no sidewalk rule. Riding on the Oak Leaf Trail is perfectly fine.

The two brands I am currently seeing are:
* [Uber-Lime](https://www.uber.com/us/en/ride/scooters/){:target="_blank"}
* [SPIN](https://www.spin.app/){:target="_blank"}

Other brands I have seen in the past:
* [Lime](https://www.li.me/){:target="_blank"}
* [Bird](https://www.bird.co){:target="_blank"}

# Meals

Agile Carpentry typically provides breakfast, snacks, and beverages in the _Upper East Side_ event space.

For lunch, it is often easiest to walk as a group to one of the table service restaurants nearby. With multi-day events and a larger group, I typically pre-arrange lunch at a different restaurant each day.

The four best walk-able table service restaurant options on the _Upper East Side_ are:
* [Maru Korean Bistro](https://www.marukoreanmke.com/){:target="_blank"}
* [Good City Brewing](https://www.goodcitybrewing.com/locations/east-side/){:target="_blank"}
* [Comet Cafe](https://www.thecometcafe.com){:target="_blank"}
* [Backstreet BBQ & Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z5cNVZ9Ap7fQuX3c7){:target="_blank"}

A forth potential restaurant choice is [Stone Bowl Grill](https://www.stonebowlgrill.com/). Stone Bowl is a dive compared to the other four places, but the food and service are good.

Please let me know of any food restrictions so appropriate accommodations can be made.

# Are Meals Included In Your Event Ticket?

## Certified LeSS Practitioner: YES

With a training event such as a _Certified LeSS Practitioner_, breakfast and lunch are typically included in the ticket price. This includes lunch at the above restaurants.

## UnConference: NO

A reasonable hosting strategy for an UnConference is to begin with the _Upper East Side_ event space, and to only relocate the UnConference to a larger _Downtown_ hotel event space once the event grows large enough to require doing so. 

The best way to keep UnConference ticket pricing low at larger attendee numbers is to have people walk to lunch in multiple organized groups. One can eat like a king in the many table service restaurants in the _Downtown_ and _Third Ward_ area for the cost of catered lunch in hotel event space. Going out for lunch not only keeps conference ticket prices lower, it also results in a better experience for participants.

Since an UnConference has a strong chance of being relocated to _Downtown_ hotel event space, lunch is not typically included in the event ticket price.

If an UnConference is in hotel event space, catering may initially be limited to beverage service. At higher attendee numbers, AM breaks and PM breaks are likely to be included as well.

## UnConference: Please Bring Cash For Lunch

Considering the UnConference lunch strategy, I recommend bringing enough cash to pay for lunch. This will make it easier for your lunch group to settle the bill without needing to ask the server to run a credit card for each person.
