# Training Venue Details

[Hilton Garden Inn San Antonio Downtown Riverwalk](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/satsdgi-hilton-garden-inn-san-antonio-downtown-riverwalk/)  
408 East Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas, United States, 78205

The Hilton Garden Inn is just over a block away from the [San Antonio Riverwalk](https://www.thesanantonioriverwalk.com/) with lots of nice restaurants, shops, and tour boats.

# Lunches Will Be Great

The venue location allows Agile Carpentry to cost effectively provide fantastic lunches outside of the training room along the Riverwalk. A few of the Riverwalk restaurants I am considering include:

* [Salt Grass Steakhouse](https://www.saltgrass.com/location/saltgrass-san-antonio-riverwalk/)
* [Paesanos River Walk](https://www.paesanosriverwalk.com/)
* [Boudros](https://www.boudros.com)
* [Bubba Gump Shrimp](https://www.bubbagump.com/location/bubba-gump-san-antonio-tx/)
* [Hard Rock Cafe](https://www.hardrockcafe.com/location/san-antonio/)

Any of these will likely be more pleasant than a catered lunch in the event space. All of these have relatively fast high volume kitchens and take reservations.

Note: The inevitable course related lunch conversations are considered to be critical to training, and students are therefore required to attend all meals. Those of you subject to [U.S. General Services Administration regulations](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/SIN_C541_4D_ODC_Guidance_for_Conferences-Rewrite.pdf) will recognize this allows you to participate as you socialize with and learn from your fellow classmates.

# Fiesta

As luck would have it, the course just happens to be scheduled immediately after the annual fiesta along the Riverwalk. For those coming from out of town, consider coming a little early to experience the fiesta.

# Course Anchored By Private Client
Agile Carpentry is grateful to have a private client who has requested this training. This client has generously agreed to allow Agile Carpentry to fill any remaining seats with public students. 

Agile Carpentry is collaborating with the private client to ensure as many people in the community as possible have an opportunity to attend, while concurrently making sure all the private client's students have a seat. It is currently expected there will be enough open seats for anyone from the community who wants to attend.
