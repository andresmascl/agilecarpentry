Expecting a 3-day mid-week course in Summer 2023.
Please reach out and let me know if you are hoping to come. 

The tentative dates are:
* Tuesday, August 8, 2023 to Thursday, August 10, 2023

There is a good chance these dates will change. For now, these are just a wild guess the hosting client and I used to work up travel estimates.

[Signing up for my newsletter](https://pages.agilecarpentry.com/) is also a good idea. I will likely send an announcement once the dates are finalized.
