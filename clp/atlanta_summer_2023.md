# Training Venue Details

TBD: Very likely in the Buckhead area at a venue near a large number of walkable restaurants.

Great advantages of the Buckhead area venues under consideration include:
* Proximity to an area where many potential attendees live
* Walkability to a number of table service restaurants
* More restaurants within a 4 minute drive
* The freedom to choose where we go as a group for lunch

Lunch is included in the price of the course.

# Consider Staying On-Airport The Last Night

The training venue will be on the northern side of Atlanta, likely in the Buckhead area. This is about 30 minutes away from [Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL)](https://www.atl.com/).

If you have an early outbound flight, you may want to consider spending the last night at one of the on-airport hotels. These are connected to the aiport terminal by the airport's [SkyTrain](https://martaguide.com/things-to-know-about-the-atlanta-skytrain/). This is the same SkyTrain you will have taken to get to the airport rental car center when you flew in.
