# LeSS Practitioner Course Available Globally

I can easily run a Certified LeSS Practitioner course or [Executive Workshop]({{site.baseurl}}/cle/global/) most anywhere the airlines can take me.

If you are interested in a private course, please contact me via email at [james@agilecarpentry.com](mailto:james@agilecarpentry.com) or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescarpenter1/).

If you are interested in having me deliver a public course in your city, please fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/7BtgehG84c73YTmJA).

As an example, my spreadsheets tell me I can run a public in-person 3-day CLP in Dubai for USD$2699/person if I can identify at least 10 people who would like one. I expect similar pricing will hold for other cities in the Gulf States.

Any course will be primarily in English, with the local language being leveraged as much as practical. See the _English and Local Language_ section below for details.

# English and Local Language

The majority of the LeSS related content is in English, including the [LeSS website](https://less.works), [LeSS case studies](https://less.works/case-studies), and [LeSS books](https://less.works/resources/learning-resources/books). My native language is English. I also [know some Spanish](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-spanish-baselang-james-carpenter/).

A small portion of the LeSS content has been translated into other languages. For example, people have graciously translated [my LeSS case study](https://less.works/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company) into [Japanese](https://less.works/jp/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company) and [Chinese](https://less.works/zh-CN/case-studies/large-server-hardware-company).

That said, I think we can collectively muddle our way through using a mix of English and the local language. My ideas to help us are below.

## Participants Can Help

I'm expecting at least some of the participants to be extremely fluent in English, with everyone else having at least workable English skills. Participants with stronger English skills should be able to translate more confusing aspects in the moment.

## Live Transcription and Live Translation

As long as I bring a little bit of audio gear with me, I am expecting to be able to use Microsoft's [Conversation App](https://translator.microsoft.com/) which provides both live transcription and live translation. Microsoft PowerPoint 365 on Mac also supports both live transcription and live translation using the same underlying translation service.

## Breakout Groups Can Use Local Language
A huge percentage of the course leverages breakout groups for both table discussions and system modeling. Each table should feel free to conduct their table discussions and system modeling activities in whatever language they are most comfortable with.

Class level discussions with me will need to be mostly in English.

## Pre-Reading Content

This course has a large amount of pre-reading content which I will distribute to those who sign up. I expect it is easier for most people with English as a second language to read English, than to hear it. 

Online text translators have become extremely good lately, so that should help with any tricky aspects of the pre-reading. I expect the entirity of the pre-reading content can easily be machine translated.

Being diligent about the pre-reading will go a very long way in helping to follow along during class.

With a bit of help, I may even be able to fully translate all the course materials into the local language.

## Awareness and Sensitivity

By leveraging all the mitigation techniques above, and remaining sensitive to the language issue, I expect we will be able to help each other overcome any language related obstacles we encounter.

Someone who doesn't know any English probably should not attend. That said, I doubt there will be many people who are interested in LeSS who don't know at least some English. If you managed to read everything here so far, your English is probably strong enough to be workable for the course.
