# Training Venue Details

TBD. Very likely downtown along the San Antonio Riverwalk.

# Lunches Will Be Great

The anticipated venue area allows Agile Carpentry to cost effectively provide fantastic lunches outside of the training room along the Riverwalk. A few of the Riverwalk restaurants I am considering include:

* [Salt Grass Steakhouse](https://www.saltgrass.com/location/saltgrass-san-antonio-riverwalk/)
* [Paesanos River Walk](https://www.paesanosriverwalk.com/)
* [Boudros](https://www.boudros.com)
* [Bubba Gump Shrimp](https://www.bubbagump.com/location/bubba-gump-san-antonio-tx/)
* [Hard Rock Cafe](https://www.hardrockcafe.com/location/san-antonio/)

Any of these will likely be more pleasant than a catered lunch in the event space. All of these have relatively fast high volume kitchens and take reservations.
