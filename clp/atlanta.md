# Scheduling Update

Everyone who is currently signed up for the Atlanta Certified LeSS Practitioner course would prefer to have it over the long weekend instead (February 18-20). The venue scheduling shuffle is in flight!

What this means for you:
* No need to take off work
* No loss of billable hours
* Fly-in Friday evening
* Fly-home Tuesday morning before anyone notices you were gone
* Spend the weekend in the pleasant Buckhead Atlanta area
* Spend Monday night at one of four on-airport hotels a short tram ride away from the security checkpoint
* Non-stop flights to almost everywhere in the United States
* Meet friendly Atlanta-based classmates who are also interested in LeSS

Please reach out ASAP if you are interested.

# Training Venue Details

*UPDATE: I don't yet know if the venue will need to change with the new dates, hopefully not. I plan to keep the course in the Buckhead area, or potentially the Perimeter area just to the north if I must. I have sent a RFQ to over two dozen hotels in the Buckhead and Perimeter area, one of which will surely have last minute space available.*

[Hyatt Place Atlanta/Buckhead](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/georgia/hyatt-place-atlanta-buckhead/atlzb)  
3242 Peachtree Road NE, Atlanta, Georgia, United States, 30305  

Great advantages of the venue include:
* Proximity to an area where many potential attendees live
* Walkability to a number of table service restaurants
* More restaurants within a 4 minute drive
* The freedom to choose where we go as a group for lunch

Lunch is included in the price of the course. The difference is we get to enjoy a social group outing and mental break from routine, instead of being trapped in the same box all day. With a smaller training cohort this is often a much better experience for everyone. I will work to pre-arrange things so we don't lose much time.

The event space is yet another air-conditioned room with banquette chairs and projector; no different than we would find at many more expensive venues. We will have access to the same breakfast bar available to hotel guests each morning. Fruit, snacks, and drinks throughout the day once the breakfast bar closes will likely be whatever I throw into an ice chest each morning. There are several nearby grocery stores, including a Whole Foods.


A couple promising restaurants within a short walk include:
* [Amalfiatl](https://www.amalfiatl.com/)
* [Louisiana. Bistreaux](https://www.louisianabistreaux.com/)

A couple restaurants a short drive away include:
* [Maggianos](https://www.maggianos.com/menus/3368-peachtree-rd./lunch/)
* [On the Border](https://www.ontheborder.com/locations/buckhead/)

I expect to do a bit more restaurant sleuthing once on the ground, and welcome any guidance.
