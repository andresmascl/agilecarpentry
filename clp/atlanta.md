# Training Venue Details

[Hyatt Place Atlanta/Buckhead](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/georgia/hyatt-place-atlanta-buckhead/atlzb)  
3242 Peachtree Road NE, Atlanta, Georgia, United States, 30305  

Great advantages of the venue include:
* Proximity to an area where many potential attendees live
* Walkability to a number of table service restaurants
* More restaurants within a 4 minute drive
* The freedom to choose where we go as a group for lunch

Lunch is included in the price of the course. The difference is we get to enjoy a social group outing and mental break from routine, instead of being trapped in the same box all day. With a smaller training cohort this is often a much better experience for everyone. I will work to pre-arrange things so we don't lose much time.

The event space is yet another air-conditioned room with banquette chairs and projector; no different than we would find at many more expensive venues. We will have access to the same breakfast bar available to hotel guests each morning. Fruit, snacks, and drinks throughout the day once the breakfast bar closes will likely be whatever I throw into an ice chest each morning. There are several nearby grocery stores, including a Whole Foods.


A couple promising restaurants within a short walk include:
* [Amalfiatl](https://www.amalfiatl.com/)
* [Louisiana. Bistreaux](https://www.louisianabistreaux.com/)

A couple restaurants a short drive away include:
* [Maggianos](https://www.maggianos.com/menus/3368-peachtree-rd./lunch/)
* [On the Border](https://www.ontheborder.com/locations/buckhead/)

I expect to do a bit more restaurant sleuthing once on the ground, and welcome any guidance.
