# Early Bird Bonus

The first 5 people who purchase a ticket have their choice of custom drinkware. The available choices are:

* [40 Ounce Road Trip Tumbler](https://rticoutdoors.com/Road-Trip-Tumbler?size=40oz&color=Storm){:target="_blank"}: The vacuum insulated stainless steel RTIC 40 oz. Road Trip Tumbler has a ceramic lined interior to protect against metallic taste. It also has a screw on lid to protect against spills. It is almost identical to the 40 oz. Stanley Quencher H2.0, and perhaps better considering the addition of a ceramic lining.
* [30 Ounce Road Trip Tumbler](https://rticoutdoors.com/Road-Trip-Tumbler?size=30oz&color=Storm){:target="_blank"}: The vacuum insulated stainless steel RTIC 30 oz. Road Trip Tumbler has a ceramic lined interior to protect against metallic taste. It also has a screw on lid to protect against spills. It is almost identical to the 30 oz Stanley Quencher H2.0, and perhaps better considering the addition of a ceramic lining.
* [18 Ounce Yeti Rambler](https://www.yeti.com/drinkware/bottles/21071060021.html){:target="_blank"}: The Yeti Rambler 18 oz. bottle with chug cap is a very nice vacuum insulated stainless steel bottle. It has a large lid which makes adding ice easy. This is perhaps a more convenient size for taking on a hike, whereas the larger tumblers are likely better in the car or at a desk.


# Travel Logistics

## Arriving By Air

Chicago is served by [two commercial airports]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/chi/plane), O'Hare (ORD) and Midway (MDW). 

O'Hare airport is a huge international airport with non-stop flights to almost anywhere on the planet. O'Hare is a hub for United Airlines and American Airlines.

Midway is a regional airport which is a bit closer to downtown Chicago than O'Hare. Southwest Airlines operates most of the flights into Midway.


## Arriving By Amtrak

![Roomette](/assets/images/clp/amtrak_roomette.jpg)

A [direct Amtrak route]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/chi/train) can be a wonderful low-stress choice for travel to and from downtown Chicago. This is especially true for anyone living in the mid-west. Only direct cross-country routes on Amtrak tend to make sense.

## Detailed Travel Logistics

See the following pages for additional travel details:
* [Travel by Plane]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/chi/plane)
* [Travel by Train]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/clp/chi/train)


# Training Venue Details

The event venue is very likely to be in the downtown Chicago area.

My intention is to ensure you can reach the training venue from Union Station with only a short walk, short ride on the L train, or five minute Uber ride.


# Lunches Will Be Great

Lunch will be provided. There is a good chance we will walk to lunch at pre-arranged table service restaurants. This will provide a better social experience for everyone, and allow us to spend some time outside of the event space.

Breakfast will also be provided. I anticipate we will be eating as a group at the event hotel restaurant each morning, or some similar arrangement.
