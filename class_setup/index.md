# Overview

A well prepared training environment helps ensure a successful outcome for everyone involved.

In a private training context, the client is often formally responsible for all hosting aspects since they are on the ground and therefore better positioned to be so. In practice ensuring a well prepared environment is a collaborative effort.

# System Modeling Whiteboards

Each table of participants in a system modeling heavy version of a Certified LeSS Practitioner course requires far more whiteboard space than is typically available in a conference room. A variety of creative solutions exist for facilitating the required whiteboard space.

A few possible solutions for temporary whiteboards include:

* [WizardWall]({{site.baseurl}}/class_setup/WhiteboardsUsingWizardWall/)

* [Panels on Easels]({{site.baseurl}}/class_setup/WhiteboardsUsingPanelsOnEasels/)

The remainder of the hosting requirements are described below, and are far less exotic than the massive whiteboard requirement.

# Responsibility Boundaries Are Negotiable

For the sake of clarity, the lists below are written from the perspective of a private course in which the client is performing all hosting responsibilities. In this scenario the only formal responsibility of the instructor is to provide course specific printed materials and to show up and teach the course. 

Agile Carpentry is able to help with some of the hosting responsibilities if desired, especially within the United States. However we collaboratively achieve it, the hosting requirements must be met and the costs of doing so must be passed onto the client in some way. By achieving this, we will have set the stage for delivering a great participant experience.


# Leveraging Agile Carpentry Infrastructure

Agile Carpentry has done a lot of research and preparation to make it possible to deliver public training anywhere on the globe, while minimizing the fees paid to conference hotel venues. The same preparation and equipment Agile Carpentry has designed for economically facilitating public training can also be used to make it easier for a client to host a private course on their own property, or at a nearby facility. 

The additional costs incurred by Agile Carpentry when providing logistical support will need to be passed onto the client, yet that is often less expensive and more convenient for the client than the alternatives.

Within the United States, Agile Carpentry can provide the following at additional cost:

Durable Equipment Available:
* PA system in a flight case
* Projector in a flight case
* Projector screen in a flight case
* Easels for whiteboard panels in a flight case

Services Available:
* Arrange to have DPI Frost White dry-erase panels and associated materials drop shipped to a client location
* Assist in the location, booking, and costing calculations of off-site meeting room space and associated catering services
* Provide kits containing various office supplies required by the training

Notes:
* Outside of the United States, only some of this additional support is practical.
* In some situations the equipment kits are fully designed in preparation for the anticipated need, but not yet assembled. In such situations manufacturing ready 3D foam designs, complete parts lists with pricing, weight calculations, size calculations, and all shipping logistics have been accounted for. The acquisition lead time is generally less than a week or two.

# Typical Private Course Responsibility Boundaries

## Agile Carpentry Responsibilities

* 3-Days of Certified LeSS Practitioner instruction and associated certifications
* Logistical guidance to help ensure the course runs smoothly
* Providing printed course pack and related specialized materials (Basic supplies such as pens, and dry-erase markers are host responsibilities.)

## Host Responsibilities: General

* Providing appropriate event space meeting all instructor requirements
* Ensuring appropriate food and beverage service is provided for all 3 days of the course for both students and instructor
* Reimbursement of instructor's travel-related expenses
* Ensuring an effective mix of participants which includes a combination of:
  + senior hands-on engineers
  + engineering management
  + business-side management with a product focus. 

Note: A carefully selected mix of participants will result in greatly improved learning outcomes, and a greater chance of creating the alignment needed to act on what is learned. Please consult with Agile Carpentry for guidance in creating an ideal participant mix.


## Host Responsibilities: Event Space

* Projector and screen, or equivalent display solution
* PA system with:
	+ wireless lapel microphone for instructor
	+ one handheld microphone for use by participants
* Instructor whiteboard and dry-erase markers in several colors
* Instructor easel with 3M Poster sized Post-It Notes with appropriate poster markers
* Instructor table and chair towards front of class for instructor's laptop and supplies
* Wireless or wired network connection for instructor laptop
	+ No network support is required for participants
* Banquette style tables and chairs which support participants sitting in pods of 4 to 5 participants each.
  + Square or round tables can both be made to work. The layout should support each pod of people having active discussions at their respective table, while being able to participate in the class as whole during whole class lecture activities.
  + Too many or too few participants at a table reduces the quality of learning outcomes possible.
* 13 to 16 linear feet of whiteboard per participant pod for system modeling 
	+ The whiteboards for some pods can be in an adjacent breakout room, provided there is standing room for the entire class cohort during debriefing sessions.
	+ Both [WizardWall]({{site.baseurl}}/class_setup/WhiteboardsUsingWizardWall/) and [panels on easels]({{site.baseurl}}/class_setup/WhiteboardsUsingPanelsOnEasels/) temporary whiteboards can be used to supplement any permanently installed whiteboards.
* Any space, tables, or other arrangements required for food & beverage service
* Instructor bar stool or similar elevated seating, ideally with back support. This is an optional requirement.


## Host Responsibility: Per Participant Table Supplies

* Dry-erase markers in several colors
* Black felt tip markers for writing on Post-It notes and index cards (e.g.: Sharpies)
* Pens for note taking for each participant
* Variety of Post-It Notes for each participant table
* Roll of [ScotchBlue painter's tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CZPL4E)
