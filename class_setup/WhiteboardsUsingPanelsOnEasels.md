#  Panel Whiteboard Overview

Each table of participants in a system modeling heavy version of a Certified LeSS Practitioner course requires far more whiteboard space than is typically available in a conference room. A variety of creative solutions exist for facilitating the required whiteboard space.

I now have a set of flight cases which allow me to fly with a set of whiteboard easels. In many cases this solution is even easier and less expensive than using [WizardWall based whiteboards]({{site.baseurl}}/class_setup/WhiteboardsUsingWizardWall/). My ability to fly with [media baggage rates](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/baggage/media-bags.html) ensures the additional checked luggage fees remain reasonable for most global destinations. I can also ship the cases within the United States via FedEx at comparable costs.

Additional details will be provided to Agile Carpentry clients as needed.
