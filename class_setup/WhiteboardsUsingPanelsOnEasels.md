#  Panel Whiteboard Overview

Each table of participants in a system modeling heavy version of a Certified LeSS Practitioner course require far more whiteboard space than is typically available in a conference room. A variety of creative solutions exist for facilitating the required whiteboard space.

If [WizardWall based whiteboards]({{site.baseurl}}/class_setup/WhiteboardsUsingWizardWall/) are not a viable solution, inexpensive dry-erase friendly panels available from your local lumberyard can be an excellent choice. As long as you purchase the correct panels, the writing surface will be far superior to what is possible with WizardWall.

The main downsides to panel based temporary whiteboards are:
* additional logistical burden
* less space efficient footprint

**Each table of up to 5 participants will require two adjacent panels for a total of 16 linear feet of whiteboard space.**

Additional details will be provided to Agile Carpentry clients as needed.
