    Working with James was a transformational experience for me, and for the team.
    He took us from "No Way Scrum Can Be Done Here" to "We Can't Ever Go Back".

    He is not only fluent in Agile methodologies, but is extremely well versed in SW development 
    methodologies -- which allows him to go toe to toe with some of the most technically astute 
    developers and senior leaders in the organization...

    Working with James was a blessing and an inspiration. He has clear aptitude in taking
    a blank canvas and creating relevant value from it, leveraging learnings 
    quickly and adaptively.

    I’ve had the opportunity to work with James on multiple projects for going on two years.
    I can’t say enough about the confidence I have in his ability to deliver.

    James is an exceptional Agile coach. He takes time to listen and understand the
    challenges behind the implementation of an approach before coming up with some
    very practical advice. He is also great in making people see the benefits of
    a proposed change.

    James's is one of the hardest working individuals that I know. While for some
    that might be enough but he is also one of the smartest and most ethical people
    I know as well.
