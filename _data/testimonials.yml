    Working with James was a transformational experience for me, and for the team.
    He took us from <em>"No Way Scrum Can Be Done Here"</em> to
    <em>"We Can't Ever Go Back"</em>.

    <p>Working with James was a transformational experience for me,
    and for the team.</p>

    <p>He took us from "No Way Scrum Can Be Done Here" to 
    <em>"We Can't Ever Go Back"</em>. He brought the team from Waterfall to Scrum.</p>

    <p>We are a team of Firmware engineers and firmly believed that
    Scrum does not belong in our field. James demonstrated that the
    Scrum is a framework to bring focus to the Software Craftsmanship,
    Quality, and way of planning our work.</p>

    <p>James coached me to act as a Product Owner, and coached the team
    past the learning curve of Scrum framework.</p>

    <p>The team found extremely useful his focus on the technical aspect
    of development, test, CI/CD. He introduced a number of concepts and
    tools to us, and worked with team members on technical side where it
    was needed.</p>

    <p>Results are very straightforward: we are practicing Scrum for
    almost a year. We have much better visibility into the backlog. The
    team engagement is better. The initial product quality is better.</p>

    <p>James has brought online a number of teams while working in our
    business unit.</p>

    <p>James thrives in environments where an understanding of technical
    software practices are required. He is not only fluent in Agile methodologies,
    but is extremely well versed in software development methodologies &mdash; which allows him to go toe to toe with some of the most technically
    astute developers and Sr. Leaders in the organization who were resistant
    to the change. I think there are very few Agile Coaches that can truly
    span the depth of knowledge going from detailed code level, up through
    higher level Agile principles and training. In my view, he was a one stop
    shop covering all aspects required to support our Agile Transformation.</p>

    <p>He always worked well with our development and leadership teams
    (He is well liked, and respected). He clearly understood the importance
    of meeting our expectations in terms of outcomes. Last but not least
    he has tremendous passion for Agile, and its benefit to
    SW & HW development environments – A very important trait in
    coaching and leading others through this type of transformation.</p>

    I’ve had the opportunity to work with James on multiple projects for going
    on two years. I can’t say enough about the confidence I have in his ability
    to deliver.

    I’ve had the opportunity to work with James on multiple projects for going
    on two years. I can’t say enough about the confidence I have in his ability
    to deliver. Not only does he preach Agility and better business practices,
    but he's in the trenches too. Not afraid to roll up his sleeves and not only
    offer a solution, but be a part of the solution.

    James is an exceptional Agile coach. He takes time to listen and understand the
    challenges behind the implementation of an approach before coming up with some
    very practical advice. He is also great in making people see the benefits of
    a proposed change.

    James&apos;s is one of the hardest working individuals that I know. While for some
    that might be enough but he is also one of the smartest and most ethical people
    I know as well.

    <p>James&apos;s is one of the hardest working individuals that I know.
    While for some that might be enough but he is also one of the smartest
    and most ethical people I know as well. It has been many years since
    I have actually worked with James. But I have to say the things that
    he and I talked about years ago have continued to resonate. Not only
    have then continued to resonate but the things he has said have come to
    life over time and influence me to this day.</p>

    <p>Jimmy &mdash; I count you as a friend and I count you as an influence
    in my life.</p>

    <p>You cannot go wrong with Mr. James Carpenter</p>

    If you are looking for an Agile coach who will tell you what you need to hear,
    James is an excellent one to reach out to.

    <p>James was the first Agile Coach I hired to start the transformation
    of the Auto Club. James has a deep developer background, which is very
    helpful in a large scale transition. Coaches without a technical
    background (I mean a real developer here) may struggle to gain the
    trust and acceptance of the developer community.</p>

    <p>James could speak to
    the developers and push for increased technical excellence on the part
    of the development teams. Large organizations with all the attendant
    dysfunctions often atrophy the skill of the developers
    &mdash;this, it shouldn't be necessary to point out,
    is management&apos;s fault&mdash;
    resulting in poor quality systems that are fragile and difficult to
    change. This problem, along with many others, gets worse over time until
    the system collapses. James understands the dangers in this path and
    will give a straight appraisal of the situation.</p>
    
    <p>James developed training for our teams (and conducted many of them)
    along with an inception process product teams could follow to start-up.
    Not sugar coating things, the training, and inception process were really
    detailed and well aligned to the Large-Scale Scrum framework we use as
    well as Agile and Scrum values in general. Critically it was revised
    each launch based on team feedback (a principal value that many
    consultants fail to live by, continuous improvement within the context
    of the organization).</p>

    <p>If you are looking for an Agile coach who will tell you what you need
    to hear, James is an excellent one to reach out to.</p>
